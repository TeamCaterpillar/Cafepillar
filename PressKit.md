## About CafePillar

*Cafepillar* is a cozy cafe-managing game where you are a caterpillar living your best life in the forest, and it's very sunny and warm and it's just about to be summer. The problem is, every caterpillar including you should have transformed by now... The god of metamorphasis visits you, wondering why you haven't transformed yet. They say they can't help directly, but is able to appoint you as their apostle to help everyone else transform. The god gives you ingredients and tells you that you can only transform after bringing the money you earn back.
Thus, you have three days to get as many caterpillars to eat.

## Gameplay

Once you start the game, customers will spawn in with their orders. Press P to switch to the kitchen, and check the recipe book for whichever orders are at the top of your list. Drag the cards to accordingly to the correct appliance and start the cooking. You can end the cooking to make the dish at any time, but it's best to wait for the bar to turn green to get the best tasting dish! After getting your dish, drag it to the tray in the top right to serve it to the customer. Press P to switch back to the front of house. There is a timer at the top displaying the in-game time, with each day starting at 6am and ending at 6pm. There is also a button to skip the day if you feel like you have made enough money, with a shop at the end where you can use your hard-earned golden seeds to purchase additional ingredient cards. Press Next Day to progress to tomorrow, and have fun managing your cafe!
